# Sentiment Analysis Application

This project is a simple sentiment analysis application that uses Node.js, Express.js, and EJS for the front-end. The application allows users to input text and receive a sentiment analysis of the input text.

This project is integrated with the `Xenova/distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english` model from Hugging Face for sentiment analysis. This model is capable of analyzing the sentiment of the input text and classifying it as positive or negative.
